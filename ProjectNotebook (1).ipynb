    "For this project, I spent 6-8 hours on learning about numpy and pandas documentations. Having zero background in coding before taking this class, I found it extremely challenging for me to utilize different libraries to achieve my purpose. Personally, knowing how a lot of tasks could be easily achieve by merely inputing parameters and checking the corresponding documentations of numpy, I tried to double the efforts and create multiple tasks in a function. Going beyond ploting, getting the max value, locating a specific row, I attempted to combine multiple tasks at once. For instance, in my function song_recommender, I had to not only creating for loop to  but also to calculating distance and variance values, storing values in numpy arrays, and creating new dataframe for better representation of the tasks. Throughout the whole designing process, I went beyond the minimum requirement and enrich myself with techniques of ploting, sorting, locating, and even learning about the usage of Euclidean distance formula in data analysis. It frustrated me a lot when i have to go back and forth to fix my code with small little errors like \"loc\" and \"iloc\" and to run pytest multiple times, but I found this period of exploration, trial and errors so rewarding and satisfying.
